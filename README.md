# Hi 2022 :wave:

## 💼 Daily working on
- Javascript and Typescript through VueJS and NodeJS
- PostgreSQL and MongoDB
- Gitlab CI/CD and a bit of devops

## 🌱 Actively growing on
- Cybersec, thanks to an active training on HTB
- Devops, as I fight with the previous point on a weekly basis

## 🔭 Looking forward to have a look at
- Rust
- And anything that could be fun!
